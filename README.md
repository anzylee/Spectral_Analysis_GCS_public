# Spectral_Analysis_GCS_public

This repository contains the datasets and MATLAB codes for spectral analysis, coherence analysis and the associated statistical analysis in "Spectral slope and coherence quantitatively summarize nested topographic variability patterns in rivers" by Anzy Lee, Belize Lane, and Gregory B. Pasternack. 

## spectral_analysis.m

This MATLAB code conducts multitaper spectral analysis. 

## coherence_analysis.m

This MATLAB code performs coherence analysis.

## freq_ang_analysis.m

This MATLAB code generates phase vs. significant frequency plots.

## regression_analysis_all.m

This MATLAB code performs regression analysis between the spectral slope of Wn/Zn and various reach-average river metrics.

## regression_analysis_Wn_Zn.m

This MATLAB code performs regression analysis between the spectral slope of Wn/Zn and the most correlated reach-average river metric (e.g., highest R^2).
